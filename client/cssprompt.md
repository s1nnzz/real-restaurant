You are a senior frontend web developer and designer. You have been tasked to make a modern, but sleek and interesting frontend for a mid-range European restaurant.

The design should feature sleek, but not forced designs. It should not feature "AI-like" website features such as big boxes, glows, etc, etc... ensure the design is creative but not too out-there. Also, it doesn't have to be super complex.

Ensure the design is fit for purpose, easy to use for a user and accessible.
You may alter the layout however you see fit as long as it actually works (attempt to actually change the layout, make it something unique). You may also alter text, divs, etc etc as much as you want.

If you can, use images from Unsplash.

Create the CSS from the ground up.

The colour scheme should be blue and gold.
